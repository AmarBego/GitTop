## Core Philosophy

**Lightweight.** GitTop typically uses 5-15MB of RAM running in your system tray. No Electron, no WebViews — just native Rust performance.

**Private.** Your GitHub tokens are stored in your OS's secure credential storage (Keychain, Credential Manager, Secret Service). We never see them.

**Open Source.** Every line of code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/AmarBego/GitTop). Audit it, fork it, contribute to it.

GitTop packs more than you'd expect from a notification tray app. Each feature is designed to help you stay focused on what matters and ignore everything else.
