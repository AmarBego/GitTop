# Multi-Account Support

GitTop supports signing in with multiple GitHub accounts simultaneously.

## Use Cases

- **Work vs. Personal**: Keep your `company-inc` notifications separate from your `personal-projects`.
- **Bot Accounts**: Monitor notifications for bot users you control.

## Switching Accounts

Click your profile picture in the sidebar to toggle between active accounts. You can also view an "All Inbox" to see everything at once.

## Security

Tokens are stored securely using your operating system's native credential manager (Windows Credential Manager / libsecret on Linux).
